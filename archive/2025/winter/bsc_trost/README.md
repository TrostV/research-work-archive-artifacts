# CXL APU - gem5 VIPER with CXL memory pooling and MESIF protocol
This is a proof-of-concept of a APU system using the CXL memory pooling.
It is based on the gem5 simulator and the VIPER GPU model.

## Building the simulation
Copy contents of gem5 directory to your gem5 source directory. (Tested with gem5 version `25.0`)
Use the `gcn-gpu` docker provided by gem5 as your build environment, e.g. with:
```
docker run                                     \
        --device /dev/kvm                      \
        --volume path/to/your/gem5:/gem5       \
        -u $UID:$GID                           \
        -it ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:v25-0
``` 

Then configure a build with:
```
/gem5 $ scons defconfig build/cxl_apu/ build_opts/VEGA_X86
/gem5 $ scons setconfig build/cxl_apu/ RUBY_PROTOCOL_GPU_VIPER_CXL_MESIF=y RUBY_PROTOCOL_GPU_VIPER=n PROTOCOL=GPU_VIPER_CXL_MESIF
```
Finally build with:
```
/gem5 $ scons build/cxl_apu/gem5.opt -j<number_of_cores>
```

## Running
Any HIP 4.0 Binary can be used, though for maximum compatibility it should be compiled in the `gcn-gpu` docker.
Running the simulation is done with: (this should also be run within the docker)
```
/gem5/build/cxl_apu/gem5.opt /gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -c <BINARY-PATH> -u <NUMBER_CUS> -n <NUMBER_CORES>
```
> [!WARNING]
> Number of CPUs must be >2 else the simulation will fail.

# Benchmarks
## Rodinia Benchmark
We adapt the [Rodinia Benchmark suite](https://github.com/yuhc/gpu-rodinia) to hip in `rodinia_hip`.
Compile it in the `gcn-gpu` docker with:
```
/rodinia-hip $ make
```
Be sure to get the data provided with hip as mentioned in its [README](rodinia_hip/README).
It seems the virginia link is down, get it from the provided dropbox link instead.

Then run it with the cxl apu using:
```
/rodinia_hip/bin $ ./run.sh all
```
Or with the original VIPER
```
/rodinia_hip/bin $ GEM5=/gem5/build/VEGA_X86/gem5.opt SUFFIX=orig ./run.sh all
```
> [!NOTE]
> You can compile the original VIPER implemenation with `scons build/VEGA_X86/gem5.opt -j<number_of_cores>`
You can also run individual benchmarks by replacing `all` with the benchmark name, e.g. `gaussian`.
The latency for the CXL APU can be specified by setting the environment variable `LATENCY`, e.g.
``` 
/rodinia_hip/bin $ LATENCY=200 ./run.sh gaussian
```

To extract the statistics used in the thesis, run
```
/rodinia_hip/bin $ LATENCY=120 ./extract.sh tcc_hitrate # or overall_rtime, overall_ipc, latency_rtime
```
To extract the statistics for the original VIPER, run
```
/rodinia_hip/bin $ SUFFIX=orig ./extract.sh tcc_hitrate # or overall_rtime, overall_ipc
```
## SLC Microbench
We implement our SLC microbenchmark in `slc_microbench`. Compile it in the `gcn-gpu` docker with:
```
/slc_microbench $ make
```
Then run it with the cxl apu using:
```
/slc_microbench $ ./run_all.sh
```
Or with the original VIPER
```
/slc_microbench $ GEM5=/gem5/build/VEGA_X86/gem5.opt SUFFIX=orig ./run_all.sh
```
To extract the statistics used in the thesis, run
```
/slc_microbench $ ./extract_stats.sh
``` 
or 
```
/slc_microbench $ SUFFIX=orig ./extract_stats.sh
```
respectively.

## Plotting
We provide the plotting scripts in the `plotting` directory.
We provide our plotting data, to use your own data, replace the files in `plotting/data` with your extracted data.
Compile all plots by running `make`
